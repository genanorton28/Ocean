        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>One word, pirates. Back in the 1800th century, a young girl spent her whole life living and sailing on a Brigantine out in the open sea. At birth, her mother gave her the name Ocean Harford, because her eyes reminded her of the ocean. Both her mother and father were also pirates, they met through a treasure hunt and decided to share the treasure. Since then, they became unstoppable, they got married, then they had me. Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Ocean. I was born on November 20th 1865, and as you can tell I have blue eyes, and I love the Ocean. However, there is one thing you should know, I’m actually half kraken, half human. How? Let me tell you the story of how I became known as The Ocean and somehow ended up in the Saladborne Estate. It all started back on January 6th 1880, where my life changed forever. It was a normal day in the sea, my crew and I were hoisting the sails, scrubbing the deck, polishing the canons, steering the helm as usual. That day was the anniversary of my parents' death, it has been two years since I lost them. My parents along with my father's crew and I found ourselves running into a group of reaper pirates. A little knowledge Reaper Pirates are a bunch of bloodthirsty pirates that will kill whoever trespasses them along with stealing gold. Nobody is brave enough to fight them, and we were the unfortunate ones. When my father spotted the reaper ship, he decided to avoid them by turning the ship around, but before we knew it, they're already on our ship. Father told my mother and I to hide at the lower deck, when we went down all I could hear were clashes from the swords, gunshots, and grunts. I have never felt so scared in my entire life in the sea. The last thing I know from that memory was my mother telling me to hide in the cabinet, blood and a sunken ship. I have lost everything that day, my parents, my crewmates, my home. I found myself in a tiny rowboat, but then I found a little hope when I heard “Ms. Harford!!”, turns out my father's first mate, William was still alive. Since then, we both went hunting for treasure, for food, hiring crewmates, and eventually got a Brigantine of my own and became known as captain wanting nothing but revenge. Back to the story, I noticed, the sea felt different that day. I knew the waters for way too long and somehow the waters looked black. They didn’t match my eyes anymore, as if there was something that shouldn’t be in the water. I ignored the feeling and continued to polish the canons, that is until I saw a red tentacle. A large squid came from the waters, red eyes staring deep into my soul, my body shakes as I yelled out “KRAKEN!!!” With a loud shriek the kraken grabbed hold onto my ship and started to destroy it. “LOAD THE CANONS. BRING ME MY SNIPER. WE WILL BE KNOWN AS THE CREW WHO KILLED THE KRAKEN '', the adrenaline in my body is rising as I felt excited yet scared. No one has ever encountered the kraken, until now. I started to shoot in the eyes with my sniper, as my crewmates and William loaded the cannons and fired at the kraken. Constant firing, constant yelling, one by one my crew has been thrown overboard. Next thing I know I was too. SPLASH into the cold water, the kraken then grabbed my legs and pulled me down into the ocean. My lungs burn begging, needing for air. All I saw was darkness, nothing but darkness. Above the ship my crewmates were able to kill the Kraken thanks to William's assistance, but sadly enough they couldn’t find me, for I had drowned. In the darkness, cold and alone, I saw a man and a woman in front of me. I felt scared but I stood up and approached them. What I found shocked me, it was my parents. I went to go hug them and they hugged me back. I miss their warmth and comfort. cried “I miss you guys”. “We miss you too, but your time isn't up yet” my father said. Confused, I asked “What do you mean?” Mother answered, “Your father and I never mentioned this but you and my child are part of the ocean, you were made more than just a pirate”. “I - I don't understand” “You will find the answer soon, for now goodbye my daughter, goodbye our ocean. We love you” my father said. That was the last thing I heard before I woke up at the bottom of the ocean, with tentacles instead of legs, gills on my neck, and fins as ears. Since then, I became known as Ocean half Kraken half Human, and I have been like this for 141 years, alone in the sea as a sea creature.</p>
